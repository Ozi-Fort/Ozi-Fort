# Welcome Dear Reader!

## About Me
  Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Adachukwu (It's hard to pronounce right?), just call me Ada.
  ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying for a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. I am interested in 
      Object-oriented programming as well as Data Analytics, and I hope to improve my problem-solving coding skills by the end of this
      school year (2025-2026).

### What I'm LearningðŸŒ±
##### -Java - My very first language. Fluent, but still learning more about it.
##### -C++ - I'm learning this to because I'm interested in implementing game development theories in object-oriented programming. (Don't ask me what that means.)
##### -Python - I'm still getting the bascis of this one down, but it's so much easier to use so far.
