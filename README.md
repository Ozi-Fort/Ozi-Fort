## About Me
  Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Adachukwu (It's hard to pronounce right?), just call me Ada.
  ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying computer science and The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley for a Bachelor's Degree. I am interested in 
      Object-oriented programming as well as Data Analytics, and I hope to improve my problem-solving coding skills by the end of this
      school year.
